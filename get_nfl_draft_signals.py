HEADLINE
The NFL draft board remains a major roster-building storyline, even when live signal data is limited in this report window.

SNAPSHOT
The live draft signals board could not be fully confirmed, so this edition falls back to broad roster-pressure framing.

KEY DATA POINTS
- Live standings-based draft order signals were unavailable during this report window.
- Quarterback pressure, offensive line demand, and coverage needs still remain core first-round themes.
- Editorial draft coverage can still center on roster repair teams, trade-up pressure, and positional scarcity.

WHY IT MATTERS
The NFL draft remains one of the strongest year-round league story engines because team-building pressure never really goes away, especially around quarterback, pass protection, and premium defensive positions.

STORY ANGLES
- Which teams are most likely to drive early-round urgency?
- Where quarterback demand could reshape the top of the board.
- Why roster repair teams and playoff teams enter the draft with very different pressure points.

WATCH LIST
- Quarterback-needy teams
- Offensive tackle demand
- Cornerback depth
- Pass-rush pressure
